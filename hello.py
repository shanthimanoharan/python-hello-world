# Welcome, new coder.
# Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!'
# to the console (the panel on the right)

print("Hello World! - by Shanthi - Test");

# Next, PLAY!
# Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

#   1. Change the message that is printed.
#   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
#   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
#   4. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#   5. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#   6. Print two messages on the same line.
#   7. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
#   8. Other. You choose!
